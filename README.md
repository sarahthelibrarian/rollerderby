# rollerderby
A final project for a data interoperability course that I scraped WFTDA rankings data and made them into a graphical representation, an HTML Bootstrap page, and a score differential generator.

#Pythonfiles has the actual code for this programming package

#data has the data used and output from this package

#outputs has the data/documents/images that are outputs from this package

#main folder has everything for ease of access!
